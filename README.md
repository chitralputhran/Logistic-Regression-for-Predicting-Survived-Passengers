# Logistic-Regression-in-Python
Applied Logistic Regression (Supervised learning model) on Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster Data-set from Kaggle

## Overview 
The following jupyter notebook contains steps I used for drawing out predictions on the survived column. Since there is a target column/ variable present, this problem gets classified as a supervised learning problem.
Steps:
1. Importing necessary libraries. (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
2. Reading in data.
2. Data Exploration and Visualization.
3. Feature Engineering. 
4. Construction of a predictive model( Any machine learning model in Surpervised Learning)
5. Fitting featurized data into the predictive model.
6. Drawing out predictions with test data.

## Dependencies:
* conda install numpy
* conda install pandas
* conda install scikit-learn
* conda install matplotlib
